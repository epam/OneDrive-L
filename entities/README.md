Introduction
============

This sub-project defines entities common for the whole project such as `LocalItem` or `Drive`.

The entities schemas are defined in IDL - [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) - and then language-specific DTO definitions are automatically generated for a target-language.

Generation of language-specific code is done using [Protocol Buffer Compiler (or Protoc) plugins](%60Protoc%20plugins%60_).

How to's
========

How to generate definitions?
----------------------------

Refer to `Makefile` in the project's root - it defines all the necessary tasks.

How to change Entity structure?
-------------------------------

1.  Locate the corresponding .proto file.
2.  Make changes referring to the official [Protocol Buffers Language version 3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) guide.
3.  Re-generate corresponding DTO definitions using the corresponding Protocol Buffers compiler plugin.
4.  Commit newly generated files to VCS.

TODO
====

-   Validation: it is not implemented because it's not so obvious how to do that. The first that comes to mind that should be validated is whether a "required" field is set or not. But it does makes sense only for a self-describing format, like JSON. For non-self describing format that uses pre-defined schemas like Protobuf it doesn't really make sense because message structure is already enforced by the parser and so what is left is validation of the field's content but not it's presence/absence and it doesn't matter whether it is 0 or "something else" since "something else" could also be erroneous (e.g. generated by a buggy client). When it makes sense to validate "required" fields is when message structure allows some fields to be absent (optional). But it is not clear at this moment how to implement usable and generic validation for such cases.
